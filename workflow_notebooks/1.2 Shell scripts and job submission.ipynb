    "When many users are trying to do data processing on a server and there are limited computing resources, how is the distribution of the computing resources handled? On scg3 and many other servers, this is handled using the Sun Grid Engine (abbreviated SGE). The basic idea is that the users puts the commands they want to run in a shell script, and then submits that script to the SGE using qsub. If you do NOT use this approach, and instead execute the commands directly on your login shell, you will be running the commands on what is called the \"head node\", which is NOT equipped to do heavy lifting; if your commands require a lot of computing resources, you will end up making the head node slow for ALL users who log in, and everyone will hate you even if they may not know who you are.\n",

    "We will walk through an example. Here is a reference for using SGE from the scg3 website: https://web.stanford.edu/group/scgpm/cgi-bin/informatics/wiki/index.php/Using_Sun_Grid_Engine. Anshul also has a summary of key commands and options on his website: https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/inotes/programming/clustersubmit/sun-grid-engine\n",
