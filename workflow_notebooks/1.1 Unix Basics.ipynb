    "We'll start by going through some basic unix commands. \"Unix\" is a term for a family of operating systems (just like \"Windows\"). The Mac operating systems (OSX) are part of the Unix family. You will also hear the term \"Linux\" a lot - linux refers to series of operating systems that are also part of the Unix family. Unix operating systems are very popular for running servers. However, while you may be used to interacting with your laptop using a graphical interface, these servers do not support graphical interfaces (as graphical interfaces are a LOT of work to build and are less flexible). Instead, you need to interact with them through the command line. Don't worry, it's easy once you get the hang of it, and it looks really cool to people who don't know what you are doing!"
