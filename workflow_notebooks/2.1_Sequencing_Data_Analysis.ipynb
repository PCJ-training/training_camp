    "During sequencing, we perform PCR, which can lead to duplicate reads. In many kinds of DNA sequencing, we want to remove duplicates so that we don't double-count signal originating from the same molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we use an algorithm called `sambamba` that looks for reads that mapped to exactly the same places in the genome. We also need to sort the aligned files before we can mark duplicates, since we need reads aligned to the same position to be next to each other in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bowtie2 also sets certian labels (or \"flags\") in the resulting alignment file to indicate information like the score of the alignment, the orientation of both mates of the fragment, and other details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these flags as a way to discard low-quality reads. [This website](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html) provides a convenient way to interpret the meaning of these bitwise flags; for conveninece they can be encoded as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we want to filter reads that fall into any of the following categories:\n",
    "- the read wasn't mapped to the genome\n",
    "- the read's mate wasn't mapped to the genome\n",
    "- the alignment reported is not the primary alignment (it is a \"runner-up\" alignment)\n",
    "- the read was marked as \"low-quality\" by the sequencer software\n",
    "- the read has a mapping quality less than 30"
